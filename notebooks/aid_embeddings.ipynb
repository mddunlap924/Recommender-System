So we do not know which each item id refers to. However, with item matrix factorization we can convert the anonymus item ids into meaningful embeddings. Then similar embeddings will be similar items. If we project the embeddings into the 2D plane (with TSNE, UMAP, PCA etc) and plot them, we can see clusters of similar items. Then one cluster may be clothing and another cluster could be electronics, etc etc.\n","\n","Using the 2D plane of item embeddings, we can draw dots and lines showing the progression of each users' activity. This allows us to understand how users shop. Do users browse similar items, then view different items, then return to buy the original items. Do users mainly explore similar items? Or do users explore all sorts of items? The plots below will illuminate user behavior and help us understand the data and build better features and models!\n","\n","**NOTE** The code for this notebook's item matrix factorization comes from CPMP's notebook [here][1] and Radek's notebook [here][2]. If you find my notebook helpful, please upvote their notebooks too!\n","\n","Enjoy!\n","\n","[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/code/cpmpml/matrix-factorization-with-gpu\n","[2]:
